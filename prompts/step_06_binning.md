# Step 6: Binning and MAG Quality Assessment

## Metadata

- **Step Number:** 6
- **Step Name:** Binning and MAG quality assessment
- **Objective:** Group assembled contigs into metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and assess their completeness and contamination
- **Context Provided:** Output from step 5 (assembly FASTA) and read alignments
- **Constraints:** Requires both assembly and read mapping; must produce quality metrics per bin
